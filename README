    # SELECT * FROM PERSON WHERE AGE >= 18

    my $q2 = $q1->search([ 'AGE >= ?', 18 ]);

    # Note: $q1 doesn't change.

    # SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME FROM PERSON WHERE AGE >= 18

    my $q3 = $q2->select("FIRST_NAME', "LAST_NAME");

    # SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME FROM PERSON WHERE AGE >= 18 ORDER BY INSERT_TIME

    my $q4 = $q3->order_by("INSERT_TIME");

    # Execute a query against a $dbh:

    my $hash = $q1->statement->selectrow_hashref($dbh);
